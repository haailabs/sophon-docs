Boosting allows you to "supercharge" your deposit and earn more Sophon Points over time. It’s important to note that the deposited assets used to activate boosters will be permanently committed, as they will be allocated to provide liquidity on Sophon mainnet (an ‘ownerless’ liquidity position) and enable the growth of the Sophon ecosystem. Any LP tokens created during this process will be burned. The initial boost multiplier is set at 5x, but this is subject to change based on various factors like community response and supply and demand.

Once you activate a boost with a specific multiplier, it's locked in. Even if the base multiplier changes later on, your boost remains at the rate you initially activated it. This means you'll continue to benefit from your chosen multiplier through the duration of your boost, regardless of any future adjustments to boost multipliers.
Remember, the assets used for boosting are permanently locked and will be dedicated to providing liquidity on the Sophon mainnet. You will not be able to withdraw those assets in the future.

## Activating Boosts

Upon depositing to a pool, a user can boost their portion or the entirety of their deposit. Boosting is a strategic decision for increasing the total SP a user can earn:
Boost activation: A user permanently allocates a portion of deposited assets to activate a boost. Permanently committed deposits will be allocated to provide liquidity on Sophon mainnet.
Partial or full boost: You can choose to boost a portion of your deposit or the entire amount. The more you boost, the greater your SP earned. For instance, if a user deposits 1000 BEAM and chooses to boost 200 BEAM, they'll have 800 BEAM left in their unboosted deposit. However, they will now earn Sophon Points at an accelerated rate (5x) on the 200 BEAM that were boosted, resulting in a higher number of Sophon Points than if they did not boost.

## Calculating Boosts

Boost multiplier: The current booster multiplier is 5x, meaning your boosted assets earn Sophon Points at five times the rate.
Boosted amount: Your boosted amount is multiplied by the booster multiplier to calculate your total boosted Sophon Points.
Total earning power: Your total earning potential is the sum of your unboosted deposit and your boosted amount.

Example: Boosting 200 BEAM with a 5x multiplier
Let's say you deposit 1000 BEAM and choose to boost 200 BEAM. This leaves you with an unboosted deposit of 800 BEAM. With a 5x multiplier, your 200 BEAM principal is amplified to a 1000 BEAM virtual stake (200 BEAM * 5). 
As a result, your total staking power becomes 1800 BEAM (800 unboosted + 1000 boosted). This means you'll earn SP as if you had deposited 1800 BEAM, even though you only deposited 1000. However, it's important to remember that only 800 BEAM of the original 1000 BEAM that you deposited will be available for withdrawal.
