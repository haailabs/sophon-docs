The crypto industry is undergoing a **transitional phase**. Over the past several years, the focus has been on building infrastructure that is scalable, secure, and decentralized to handle large transaction volumes.

## The Problem

<Info>Onboarding users isn’t just about building robust technical infrastructure; it’s about creating sleek, consumer-focused applications.</Info>

### Current Challenges
1. **Infrastructure Saturation**: While the infrastructure side of the industry has matured, adoption has been slow because:
   - **User experiences** often remain overly technical and unintuitive.
   - Applications built on these infrastructures often fail to appeal to a broader, non-crypto audience.
2. **Speculation-Driven Products**: Many existing crypto applications are driven by speculation, making them:
   - Unsustainable during market downturns.
   - Short-lived due to their reliance on liquidity cycles.

<Note>Crypto rails have the potential to **redefine financial primitives**, but they must evolve beyond speculation-driven use cases to achieve sustainable, mass adoption.</Note>
