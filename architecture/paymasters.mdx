**Paymasters** are a new type of specialized account in the ZKsync ecosystem that can subsidize transaction fees for other accounts. The fees can be paid using other ERC-20 tokens beyond ETH, making it ideal for Sophon.

The implementation of Paymasters greatly elevates the general user experience. Here are some examples:

1. A protocol can sponsor the transaction fees for all of its users, incentivizing them to use their protocol
2. Limits can also be imposed. For example, the top five users get 1,000 free transactions allotted to them
3. Create an NFT that allows holders to forego paying transaction fees
4. Allow users to pay gas fees with a different ERC-20 token other than SOPH for value accrual
