A Validium is a specialized blockchain scaling solution that uses off-chain data availability to offer better privacy and cheaper transaction costs.

Validiums process transactions off-chain and only publish limited transaction data to the Ethereum base layer.

Validiums use validity proofs on Ethereum layer 1 to ensure that the transaction data is trustworthy and not malicious.

A validity proof is a proof attached to every batch of transactions published to the Ethereum base layer. These transactions are only accepted and verified on the base layer if they have this attached validity proof, which proves their correctness.

Sophon uses this Validium technology and will be live on ZKsyncâ€™s Elastic Chain.
