A Validium is a specialized blockchain scaling solution designed to improve scalability by utilizing off-chain data availability. This approach offers several advantages, including enhanced privacy and reduced transaction costs.

## Key Features of Validiums

**Off-Chain Transaction Processing:** Validiums process most transactions off-chain, reducing the load on the base layer. Only a limited set of transaction data is published to the Ethereum base layer, optimizing performance and lowering costs.

**Validity Proofs:** To ensure the integrity of off-chain transactions, Validiums use validity proofs on Ethereum Layer 1. These proofs ensure that the transaction data is trustworthy and has not been tampered with.

**Transaction Verification:** A validity proof is attached to every batch of transactions before it is published on the Ethereum base layer. The Ethereum network only accepts and verifies these transactions if they are accompanied by a valid proof, confirming the correctness of the data.

### Sophon and Validiums

Sophon leverages Validium technology to provide an efficient, scalable solution. It will be implemented on the ZKsync Elastic Chain, bringing the benefits of Validiumâ€™s off-chain processing and privacy features to the ZKsync ecosystem.
