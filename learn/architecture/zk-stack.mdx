The ZKsync team created the Elastic Chain concept to combat the interoperability issues in the current multichain ecosystem.

In the current landscape, we do not simply have multiple layer 1s: we also have a plethora of layer 2s. While this is good for scalability, it is poor for the general user experience because liquidity gets fragmented across these different ecosystems, meaning user attention is similarly fragmented.

Ultimately, each L1 and L2 only gets a small amount of user mindshare because the abundance of scaling solutions has made the individual ecosystem user experience suboptimal.

However, fragmentation is not the only issue. Even bridging assets between these chains is a tedious task.

For starters, a third-party bridging protocol involves a major element of trust. Bridge protocols are notorious for being the most hacked protocols in the industry, so simply trying to move assets across chains already involves significant risk. But beyond the exploit risk, there is also the issue of subpar execution.

For example, imagine a user who has funds on Chain A but identifies a trade opportunity that is only available on Chain B. The user will first have to find a reliable bridge. After that, the user must initiate the transaction, sign it, and pay a substantial fee. Once approved, they must wait for the bridge to move the funds, which often takes a long time.

Once the funds arrive on the destination chain, they can make their trade. But in most cases, once this entire process is completed, the potential trade opportunity has almost certainly disappeared.

Thus, ZKsync has built the Elastic Chain.

## What Is the Elastic Chain?

The Elastic Chain is essentially a network of seamlessly interoperable ZK chains. These ZK chains can be rollups, volition, or a Validium like Sophon.

All the different ZK chains are connected at the protocol level, meaning the movement of assets and users across this network of chains is seamless and near-instant.

As the name suggests, this federation of chains will be elastic, meaning the supply can respond to demand. In this case, the thing being supplied is blockspace.

As the demand for blockspace increases or decreases, the network can adapt by either adding or removing instances to create an optimally scalable network.

From the user perspective, the Elastic Chain offers a multi-chain ecosystem that feels like a single chain that is easy to use, cheap, and very secure.

From a technical perspective, the chain has three core components to its architecture:

- ZK Router
- ZK Gateway
- ZK Chains

Hereâ€™s a relatively long analogy to better explain how these elements work together.

Think of the Elastic Chain as a vast network of interconnected streams and rivers.

The main river (Ethereum) acts as the source, flowing through the middle of this ecosystem. Then, streams and tributaries (ZK chains) come off this main river, helping distribute the flow of water (transactions) in case the main river is overflowing.

But this network of water bodies is not ordinary. Over the years, it has adapted to its surroundings.

When there is a massive thunderstorm (major influx of transactions), rather than flooding the river banks, the streams and tributaries (ZK chains) can expand or contract (more/fewer instances) to respond to the changes in water level.

In this way, the network is always optimal as it can quickly react and adapt to demand.

Then you have natural filters like sand, silt, and minerals (ZK Router) that filter and smoothen the flow of water (verify transactions) before it flows back into the main river (Ethereum).

Of course, any good ecosystem, or body of water, supports life: dApps and users. The connections (ZK Gateway) between the various streams and tributaries (ZK chains) allow the different forms of life to interact seamlessly without any hiccups.

In crypto terms, this means the seamless movement of users and liquidity, as well as infinite composability between the various ZK chains and the respective applications.

Sophon is one of the chains in this vast network of ZK chains within the Elastic Chain vision.

By existing within the broader Elastic Chain ecosystem, Sophon benefits from limitless scalability, seamless interoperability, and composability, all of which align perfectly with the grander vision of creating the hub of consumer crypto.
