***The mission explained.***

The crypto industry is currently in a transitional phase. For years, the focus has been on building out infrastructure that is sufficiently scalable, secure, and decentralized so that there are networks in place that can handle large volumes of transactions.

Although not perfect, the infrastructure side of the industry has reached an adequate scale, with a point of oversaturation.

Onboarding users does not happen with purely technical infrastructure. Well-built infrastructure is ultimately abstracted away for sleek consumer applications to flourish.

Unfortunately, the crypto industry has had major challenges in this department. Beyond speculation-driven products, very few crypto-native applications have gained significant traction.

If most products are driven purely by speculation, they are ultimately susceptible to changing liquidity cycles, making them unsustainable and short-lived.

Yes, crypto rails are great for financial primitives as they have the potential to completely reshape how we interact with money. But you have to think beyond this. Being the first truly internet-native form of money not governed by any jurisdiction or controlled by any single entity is a very powerful primitive.

Applications driven purely by speculation are not the best way to wield the power given to us. Hence, Sophon is stepping in to completely redefine the on-chain experience by being the hub of consumer crypto.

### What is consumer crypto?

Consumer crypto presents the best opportunity as the crypto industry begins its search for widely used applications rather than infrastructure and speculation-driven applications.

But what does consumer crypto mean?

Consumer crypto refers to a new sector that focuses on applications built to extend beyond the existing crypto-native audience.

Whether it encompasses improving the Web2 experience of a certain product or simply for entertainment purposes, consumer crypto targets applications demanded by the masses.

It’s time we start treating users as consumers rather than products.

Consumer crypto can take many forms, from gaming and betting to ticketing and social platforms.

It encapsulates anything that changes the on-chain experience from purely speculative to entertaining and engaging for everyone.

Therefore, the market opportunity for consumer crypto and Sophon is essentially a culmination of multiple sectors.

Estimates suggest that the ticketing industry is a $100B sector, gaming is a $285B industry, online betting is a $50B+ industry, and social platforms are among the most widely used applications on the internet.

Data suggests that there are 5.2 billion users of social platforms worldwide. These 5.2 billion users spend an average of 2h 20m daily on social platforms, with Youtube and Whatsapp being the most used, followed closely by Facebook and Instagram.

Just to give you a rough idea in terms of valuations. YouTube is valued at around $31B in 2024, and Meta, with all of its social media platforms, is valued at around $1.4T. Naturally so, given that these are the most widely used platforms on the internet.

Therefore, from Sophon’s context, the market opportunity is all of these sectors combined into one. Being able to tap into every sector makes the market opportunity huge, but integrating all these sectors onto crypto rails could really take things to the next level.

Using a digital native monetary system to seamlessly plug into these apps can completely change the user experience. Only time will tell just how big these consumer apps can become when integrated with crypto.

Whether it's gaming, gambling, or content distribution platforms, they can all be elevated by crypto infrastructure.

But the aforementioned are just a few of the potential sectors that Sophon encapsulates.

More broadly, Sophon simply provides the infrastructure that allows a non-crypto native audience to seamlessly interact with crypto and benefit from it.

Therefore, regarding market opportunity, it encapsulates any online industry or product, with the key difference being crypto integrations.

Crypto is the best form of internet-native money and will ultimately become the digital money layer of the internet. Sophon will be the platform that bridges the gap between consumer-focused applications and crypto rails to create the ultimate platform for online experiences.

In short, the market opportunity for consumer crypto and Sophon is Valhalla.
