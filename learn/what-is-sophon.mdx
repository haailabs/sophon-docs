***The basics explained.***
 
Sophon is a ZK chain that is part of ZKsyncâ€™s broader [Elastic Chain vision](https://zksync.mirror.xyz/BqdsMuLluf6AlWBgWOKoa587eQcFZq20zTf7dYblxsU). 

Sophon is built on a Validium and is part of the ZK Stack. Being built as a layer 2 network allows Sophon to offer higher throughput and very low transaction fees for users to take advantage of the engaging and culturally rich ecosystem that we are building.

Beyond the scalability is the interoperability Sophon gains by being part of the Elastic Chain vision.

Being a ZK chain means that Sophon and its users can interact with any other ZK chain seamlessly and vice versa, thus preventing any fragmentation of liquidity. This interoperability allows Sophon to further enhance the on-chain experience.
