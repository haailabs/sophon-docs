There are two types of nodes in the Sophon Network:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Full Nodes">
  This is a complete node that maintains a full copy of the Sophon chain. It can function as a sequencer or validator, but in the early stages, only one node will be able to submit batches, which will be run by Sophon Labs. Eventually, this process will be decentralized.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Light Nodes">
  Sophon Light Nodes present a more cost-effective way to participate in the Sophon network. They download only the bare minimum data required to transact and will typically perform data availability sampling. Although the light node structure is still being developed, it is the easiest route to participating in the Sophon Network.
