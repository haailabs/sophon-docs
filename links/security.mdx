## Staying Safe in the Sophon Ecosystem

Phishing and online scams are some of the most common tactics used by fraudsters to steal funds, sensitive information, or access to your accounts. As part of the Sophon ecosystem, it is crucial to stay vigilant and ensure you interact only with verified and trusted applications, contracts, and addresses.

### Common Tactics Used by Scammers

- **Fake Websites:** Lookalike domains designed to mimic legitimate platforms.
- **Malicious Links:** Fraudulent links shared through emails, DMs, or social media.
- **Impersonation:** Fake accounts posing as official representatives of Sophon.
- **Fake Contracts:** Contracts claiming to offer benefits but actually designed to drain your wallet.
- **Warning:** Always double-check the authenticity of any website, app, or wallet address before interacting.

### Verify to Trust

To help you stay secure, Sophon provides an official verification tool to confirm whether an address, application, or contract is authentic and safe to use.

### Best Practices to Avoid Scams

- **Verify Everything:** Use the verification app before sending funds or approving contracts.
- **Check Sources:** Only trust information shared through Sophon's official channels.
