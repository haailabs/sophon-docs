## Aethir 

The AI sector is rapidly growing and here to stay. As the sector continues to grow, the demand for GPUs and compute power will only continue to grow.

[Aethir](https://aethir.com/) is a distributed network that aggregates industry-grade GPU chips under its umbrella to provide near-instant access to compute power.

By continuously growing its GPU network, Aethir simply increases the supply to always be able to provide on-demand compute power for AI researchers or programs.

This infrastructure is live on Sophon, allowing everyone cheap and quick access to decentralized compute.

## CARV
