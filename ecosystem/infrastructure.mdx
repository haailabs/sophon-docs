## Avail 

[Avail](https://www.availproject.org/) is the unification layer of Web3.

Its infrastructure product suite consists of 3 elements: a data availability layer, a cross-chain hub, and a staking interface. Integrating with Avail grants protocols access to this state-of-the-art infrastructure.

To help further scale Sophon and be interoperable with the Avail ecosystem, Sophon has partnered with Avail for data availability.
