Ticketing is a massive $100B industry that is instrumental in the functioning of festivals, concerts, movies, shows, museum visits, and so on.

Unfortunately, the Web2 version of online ticketing is rife with scams and illegal ticket scalping, which is extremely hard to stop due to the vastness of the internet.

NFTs provide the perfect solution for this because a ticket's authenticity and ownership is verifiable on-chain. In addition, secondary marketplace scamming is no longer a concern, as buyers can verify that the NFT ticket is real.

Itâ€™s simply the best version of online ticketing.

[OPEN](https://onopen.xyz/) is the platform providing the infrastructure for this NFT ticketing solution, and OPEN is available on Sophon.

So if you want quick and cheap access to tickets for a wide range of events, look no further than OPEN on Sophon.
