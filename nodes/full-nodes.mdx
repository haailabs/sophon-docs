A **Sophon Full Node** is a complete node that stores a full copy of the blockchain and can serve as either a sequencer or a validator. During the initial phase of the network, only one node, operated by Sophon Labs, is authorized to submit batches. However, efforts are underway to allow multiple nodes to collaborate through a consensus mechanism, adhering to the relevant network criteria, which will further decentralize block creation. At present, anyone can run a read-only version of the full node.
