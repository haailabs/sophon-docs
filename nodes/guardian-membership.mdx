## Claiming & Using Guardian Membership

Those who participated in the **Sophon Node Sale** on **April 30, 2024**, will be able to **claim their Guardian Membership** once the mainnet is live.

---

### Claiming Guardian Membership

Requirements for Claiming Membership:

- Adherence to the **Node Sale Terms & Conditions**
- Completion of **KYC requirements**
- Guardian Memberships are **non-transferable** for the first year after genesis

---

### Using Your Guardian Membership

Once claimed, there are **two options** for using your Guardian Membership:

#### 1. Running a Node  

Anyone can run either a **Full Node** or **Light Node** on the Sophon Network. However, certain **network criteria** must be met to qualify:  

| Type            | Requirements                                                                                         | Notes                                                                                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Node**   | Requires **at least 1,500 Guardian Memberships** delegated to the node operator.                     | Designed for larger-scale participation.                                                          |
| **Light Node**  | Requires **between 1 and 20 Guardian Memberships** delegated to the node operator for rewards.       | - More than 20 memberships? Split into **2 light nodes** for optimal reward distribution.       |

**Example**:  
To run a light node and maximize rewards:

```plaintext
If you have 25 Guardian Memberships, split them into two nodes:  
- Node 1: 20 memberships  
- Node 2: 5 memberships  
This ensures all Guardian Memberships are eligible for rewards.
```

#### 2. Delegating Guardian Membership

If you do not wish to operate a node yourself, you can delegate your membership to trusted node operators to:

- Help secure the network
- Earn passive rewards

#### Delegator Rewards

<Warning>**Full Node** and **Light Node** operators must specify the reward rates for delegators. Rewards are distributed based on the number of memberships delegated.</Warning>
