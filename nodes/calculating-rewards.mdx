Operating a node or delegating to a node operator comes with rewards. A total of 20% of the SOPH supply will be allocated to node rewards distributed over three years. The rewards will be distributed as follows:
 
## Full Nodes

A total of 5% of the SOPH supply is allocated to full node rewards.

This will be distributed proportionally over three years, with approximately 0.032% distributed weekly.

**Example Calculation:**

- Let’s assume an operator has **20,000** delegated memberships
- The total supply of $SOPH tokens is **10 billion**
- Weekly distribution is approximately **0.032%** of the total supply
- There are **80,000** active delegated memberships, including yours
- Your weekly reward would be:
- $$\frac{10^{10} \times 0.00032 \times 20,000}{80,000} \approx 800,000$$ $SOPH

## Light Nodes

10% of the SOPH supply is allocated to light node rewards.

This will be distributed proportionally every week. It has a linear vesting over three years, with approximately 0.064% distributed weekly.

However, there is a minimum liveness threshold to meet to qualify for the rewards.

**Example Calculation:**

- Let’s assume there is an operator running a light node with **20** memberships delegated to it
- The total supply of $SOPH tokens is **10 billion**
- There are **60,000** active memberships
- The reward is distributed weekly over **156 weeks**
- The weekly reward of that operator would be:
- $$\frac{10^{10} \times 0.1 \times 20}{156 \times 60,000} \approx 2,136$$ $SOPH

## Delegated Guardians

Another 5% of the SOPH supply will be used to reward those who delegated their **Guardian Membership**.

This 5% will be distributed proportionally every week over three years and will only be given to delegated memberships that are on currently active nodes.

<Note>Each active member receives **1/(total supply of memberships)** portion of the weekly reward.</Note>

Memberships that are not active for a given week do not receive the weekly reward

**Example Calculation:**

- Let’s say you own **1** membership. Here’s how your weekly reward is calculated:
- The total supply of $SOPH tokens is **10 billion**.
- **5%** of this supply is allocated for rewards over **3 years**.
- There are approximately **120,000** memberships in total, and the reward period lasts for **156 weeks**.
- To calculate your weekly reward: &#x20;
- $$\frac{10^{10} \times 0.05}{120,000 \times 156} ≈ 27$$ $SOPH
