Deploying a light client node is the most accessible way to help maintain the Sophon Network. Light nodes don’t require powerful hardware to be ran successfully and launching is a straight forward process regardless of your chosen setup. When deploying your light node, you have 3 options and these are all easy to select from within our Guardians App [Provide Link]

## Use a Direct Service Provider (Easy)

The Guardian App currently directly supports Easeflow setup [Link]. Just follow the instructions and your light node will automatically be configured and deployed. 

<Note>Easeflow has no upfront cost but takes a 3% commission on operator rewards.</Note>

Other 3rd parties may also provide Worry Free setup through their own platforms.

## Use Railway Cloud Provider (Intermediate)

Use Railway [Link] to automatically deploy your environment. Follow the steps within the Guardians App to configure. 

This set up gives you full control of your light node and has an estimated cost of $5/Month.

## Configure With Docker (Advanced)

If you’re comfortable with running and maintaining your own environment, you can utilise our Docker Filers here. [Link]

For more detailed set up instructions, you can check that out here. [Note to Brynn, not sure if Gio is drafting these, if not, feel free to take this sentence out]

If you choose to run your own hardware, these are the minimum system requirements for light nodes:

| **Component**                 | **Minimum** | **Recommended** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| RAM                           | 512MB       | 1 GB            |
| CPU (amd64/x86 Architecture)  | 2 core      | 4 core          |

## Guardians App Dashboard

No matter your setup choice above, you can use the guardians app to monitor the status of your light node in our node dashboard.

You can also see and manage your rewards from this interface as you receive them.
