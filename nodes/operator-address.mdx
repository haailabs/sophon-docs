# How to Find Node Operator Address

Every **Light Node** needs an operator address to participate in the rewards program, and this address is the one that must receive Guardian Membership delegations.

The guide below will help you find or setup the address.

---

### If you did one click deploy with Easeflow

Don’t worry, **Easeflow** automatically manages and sets the operator address for your light node. Just follow the steps within the Guardians app to configure and manage. 

### If you are using another Node as a Service (NaaS) platform

If the operator address isn’t provided within the application, you may need to contact the platform to retrieve this information. 

### If you are using Railway or running Docker images

When you initiate your deployment, you had to provide some Environment Variables, including the operator address. 

<Warning>If you didn't set a different address to receive your comission rewards, you must have control over the operator address to claim your **$SOPH** when they are available.</Warning>
